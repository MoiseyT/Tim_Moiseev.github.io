                    <p>In this tutorial you can learn, how convert a digital elevation model (DEM) along the Kamchatka
                        river into a
                        relative elevation model (REM) using Google Earth Engine. This manual includes imagery
                        processing and interpolation with Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method. The guide was inspired
                        <a href="https://bgi.obs-mip.fr/data-products/grids-and-models/wgm2012-global-model/"
                            target="_blank">by Daniel Coe, who made it for QGIS.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>The example dataset includes an ArcticDEM (digital terrain model) the Kamchatka River valley in
                        Kamchatka peninsula and polyline shp-layer (Kamchatka channel) from OSM (OpenStreetMap). You can
                        do the project in the Google Earth Engine, except for one step.
                        This step may be easier to make in QGIS, ArcGIS etc.</p>
                    <p>
                        REM (Relative elevation model) is used in observation of terraces, floodplains, oxbow lakes etc.
                        You can read more about REMs by this <a
                            href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/19b6bfe0c3aa454c853bd6d9b7228adf"
                            target="_blank">link.</a> Usially, specialists operate the LiDAR imagery, but
                        it requires financial costs. However, even without LiDAR imagery, we can get a good result using
                        open data. SRTM is useless for this purpose due to low spatial resolution (~30 meters), but
                        ArcticDEM fits well (~2 meters).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, we should register account in Google Earth Engine. Next we load the floodplain
                        contours of the Kamchatka River and the layer with points along the channel (chainwaterways) to
                        the project. We cheated a little bit and preprocessed the channel line in QGIS - we splited the
                        line into points with equal interval of 80 m (this is the approximate average width of the
                        Kamchatka river channel).
                    </p>

                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>
                        In the next step, we add and clip raster from the Google Earth Engine database along the
                        boundaries of the Kamchatka River floodplain and load it. It is made to reduce cloud
                        computation. Thereby, the area includes the landforms of Kamchatka valley (floodplain, terraces,
                        etc). Let's look at the result:
                    </p>

                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>
                        Let's add elevation values to the point layer (we want know the altitude values in each point).
                        For this purpose we convert the ArcticDEM image to imageCollection and use getRegion() function
                        to add the elevation values from the image. Next, we modify the list to FeatureCollection and
                        upload the file to Google Drive for further processing.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/REM/4.JPG">
                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>

                        Next we remove some points that have no elevation values as well as negative values. We did this
                        in QGIS. It can probably be done in Google Earth Engine as well. After processing points, we
                        uploaded the file to our project.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/REM/5.JPG">
                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>
                        We calculate the mean and standard deviation to interpolate our points with IDW method.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/REM/6.JPG">
                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>
                        On the next step we subtract InterpolatedElev from the image with elevation that we loaded
                        previously (ArcticDEM image). Let's add a palette for amazing visualization.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/REM/7.JPG">
                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we obtain a REM raster with elevation relative to the Kamchatka riverbed. Also, we can
                        download the raster to the desktop or cloud (e.g. Google Drive).
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/img/REM/8.JPG">
                    <i>REM of Kamchatka river valley</i>
                    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                    <p>
                        ArcticDEM considers tree heights which can distort the result. Nevertheless, ArcticDEM is in
                        open access, unlike Lidar imagery. Therefore, we got a satisfactory result, which is good fit
                        for environmental science projects. Also we can process larger dataset then using QGIS.
